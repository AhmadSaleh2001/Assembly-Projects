## How to Play

1. The game board is represented by a 3x3 grid, with each cell numbered from 1 to 9 as shown below:

1 | 2 | 3

4 | 5 | 6

7 | 8 | 9

2. Players will take turns making their moves. Player 1 is assigned 'X', and Player 2 is assigned 'O'.

3. To make a move, each player should enter the number corresponding to the desired cell. For example, if Player 1 wants to place their symbol in the center cell, they should enter 5. If Player 2 wants to place their symbol in the bottom-left cell, they should enter 7.

4. The game will validate the move and update the game board accordingly. If the entered cell number is not valid (out of range or already occupied), an error message will be displayed, and the player will be prompted to enter a valid move.

5. The game will continue until one player wins or the game ends in a draw. A player wins if they have three of their symbols ('X' or 'O') in a row, column, or diagonal. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

6. After the game ends, the final board state will be displayed along with the outcome (winner or draw). Players can choose to play again or exit the game.

## Game Controls

The game controls for making moves are as follows:

- Enter the cell number to make a move. Use the numeric keypad or number keys on your keyboard to enter the corresponding number.
