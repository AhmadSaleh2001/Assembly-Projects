# Assembly Projects using Irvine Library

This README file provides an overview of the assembly projects developed during the second semester of the academic year 2022-2023. The projects utilize the assembly programming language and the Irvine Library, which is a popular library for assembly language programming on the x86 architecture.

## Project List

The following projects were created during the semester:

1. **Family Tree Manager**: Responsible for visualizing a tree of people and printing them in a similar way to the Windows operating system's "tree" command in CMD.
2. **Simple Snake Game**
3. **File Management Program**: Responsible for writing to and reading from files efficiently.

## Getting Started

To run these assembly projects, follow the steps below:

1. Download the Irvine Library from the official website or the designated source provided by your instructor.
2. Install the Irvine Library according to the provided instructions.
3. Set up an assembly development environment (e.g., Microsoft Visual Studio, MASM32) and configure it to use the Irvine Library.
4. Open the project file in your chosen development environment.
5. Build the project by compiling the assembly source code and linking it with the Irvine Library.
6. Run the compiled executable to execute the project.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my gratitude to Dr. Hasan HajHamad for teaching this amazing course. I learned a lot from him and gained valuable insights and ideas that I implemented in these projects.
