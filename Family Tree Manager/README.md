# Family Tree Manager

This README file provides an overview of the Family Tree Manager project, developed using assembly language and the Irvine Library. The Family Tree Manager is a program designed to represent and visualize a family tree in a similar way to the "tree" command in Windows CMD.

## Project Description

The Family Tree Manager project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for representing and managing family trees. It allows users to input information about individuals, their relationships, and their connections within the family tree. The program then visualizes the tree structure and provides the ability to print it in a nice and organized manner, resembling the output of the "tree" command in Windows CMD.

## Features

The Family Tree Manager project offers the following features:

1. **Tree Visualization**: The program displays the family tree structure in a hierarchical format, visually representing the relationships between individuals.

2. **Addition and Modification**: Users can add new individuals to the family tree and modify the existing information, such as names, ages, and relationships.

3. **Print Functionality**: The Family Tree Manager provides a print functionality that generates a well-formatted output, similar to the "tree" command in Windows CMD, making it easier to understand and analyze the family tree.

## Getting Started

To run the Family Tree Manager project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have the Irvine Library installed. If not, download it from the official website and install it according to the provided instructions.

2. Set up an assembly development environment that supports the Irvine Library, such as Microsoft Visual Studio or MASM32.

3. Open the project file in your chosen development environment.

4. Build the project by compiling the assembly source code and linking it with the Irvine Library.

5. Run the compiled executable to launch the Family Tree Manager program.

## Usage

1. Upon launching the Family Tree Manager, you will be prompted to enter information about the individuals in the family tree.

2. Use the provided commands to add new individuals, specify relationships, and modify existing entries as needed.

3. To print the family tree in a well-organized format, select the print option from the menu. The output will resemble the output of the "tree" command in Windows CMD.
